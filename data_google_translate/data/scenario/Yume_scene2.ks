"...Because none of us committed suicide...
Also, the cause of death was either exhaustion, freezing to death, or natural causes. It would be troubling if there was a rule that said, "If you commit suicide, you'll be sent to another world." [l][r]
"That's true, but..." [l][r]

[r]Drinking coffee in the airport lounge[r]
We were still talking about the day when Tito collapsed.
[cm] "Maybe I was wrong...?" Chito muttered, sounding unsure of herself, which was unusual for her. [l][r]
"No, I'm not blaming you. I'm just surprised you could make such a choice." [l][r]
"Really?" [r]
"Oh, I think it's amazing." [l][r]
"...I'd be happy if that were the case." [r]
When I gave her an honest compliment, she gave me a smile that was appropriate for a girl her age. [l][r]

In the end, Chito didn't try to force Yuri to come over. [l][r]
[r]There is no way that Chito would kill Yuri based on an uncertain hypothesis, but even so, it was impressive that she managed to endure it. [l][r]
I don't think he would directly say "Go die," but if I were in the same position, I would probably hint at it a little, or leave it up to the other person to decide, saying it's just a hypothesis.[l][r]

Tito said, "If I came to a world that wasn't here...
"If you come to Tokyo, look for me there." [l][r]
When I asked if there was an address or phone number, [r]
"Do you think you'll remember?" he asked. Well, you're right. [l][r]
[r]Women named Tito are rare, and maybe enough.[l][r]
If Yuri was going to look for him, then we would look for him too, and it would be much easier than finding the old man.[l][r]

"Isn't it about time?" [l][r]
"...it's still okay." [l][r]
It was actually quite a close call, but I was sad to say goodbye too. I wanted to see Chito's face a little longer. [l][r]

[r] Since then, Chito has successfully passed the university entrance exam.[r]
I have been attending for two years now.[l][r]
Since breaking away from the "haze," he has been healthy both physically and mentally, and since his grandfather's investigation was over, he has been meeting with her less and less.[l][r]

[cm] College life seems fun and busy, and I was in love with my partner. [l][r]
[r]Yes, this is my honeymoon flight. [l][r]
The period is six months, and the delivery time is also six months. [l][r]
[r]Of course, the name of that lover is "Work." [l][r]

"What are you going to do now?"[l][r]
"I probably won't go on to a master's program. I'll just start looking for a job." [l][r]
"No, it's right after this. Are you stopping by somewhere on your way home?" [l][r]
"Hmm. I'll go see Ishii's plane fly first and then head home." [l][r]
[r] "You don't have to go out of your way to see me off." [r]
I said this without hiding my joy, [l][r]
"Well, I might fall. I'm worried," Chito replied with a laugh. This guy... [l][r]

There was barely time to clear immigration. After saying goodbye to Tito, I hurried off. [l][r]
[r]Um, which way? Right? Left? [l][r]
This airport is too big. There are too many people and the guide is unhelpful. [l][r]

"Ah, maybe." [l][r]
I look over the signboard, trying to find my way. [l][r]
[r]"Hey. Do you remember me?"[l][r]
A strange voice interrupts my thoughts.
Ugh. Stop making noise. [l][r]
[r] "Hey, Ishii, right? It's me. [r]
I am.‚Äù [l][r]
A familiar voice certainly said that. I turned my gaze in that direction. [l][r]

"Oh, it's Ishii after all. Yay." [l][r]

"That's right. Good thing you remembered." [l][r]
"What on earth are you doing here?! Why, how, are you here?!" [l][r]
"Huh? Just take a plane." [l][r]
"No, not exactly." [r]
"Hmm? Then what? Oh, by the way, is Ishii going somewhere now too?" [l][r]
Yuri said as if they had met at a convenience store or somewhere. Oh come on!! [l][r]

[r]I realized later that this was probably the first time in my two lives that I had ever been so confused.
However, no matter how chaotic it may be, you must avoid missing your flight.[l][r]

I cursed the timing of this business trip, but then I thought it was a good idea. It was a casual relationship. [l]Oh, is that a word that is only used for couples or parents and children? [l][r]
Either way, the airport is probably filled with the smiles and tears of the happiest couple in the world right now.[l][r]
Just thinking about it makes my heart feel warm like the spring sun.
